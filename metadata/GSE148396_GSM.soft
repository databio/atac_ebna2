!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_description = P3HR1_ATAC.bw
!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = Library strategy: Hi-ChIP
!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA and sequenced at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility. For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = Library strategy: Hi-ChIP
!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).

For ChIP-seq, libraries were prepared via ChIPmentation (Schmidl et al. 2015).  ATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the standard protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2015). HiChIP-seq libraries were prepared following Mumbach et al. (Mumbach et al. 2016).

!Sample_data_processing = Library strategy: Hi-ChIP
!Sample_data_processing = All data was confirmed to pass all quality control checks using FastQC (version: 0.11.2) (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), except for adapter sequence contents, which were removed using cutadapt (trimgalore version: 0.4.2)(https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200).
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, STAR (version: 020201) was used to align the reads. For ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiChIP-seq, Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) was used to align the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq, EBNA2 ChIP-seq were merged using Samtools (version: 1.6). For ATAC-seq and HiChIP-seq, reads in same infection type were pooled (ATAC-seq into one file, HiChIP-seq into two replicates) using zcat command.
!Sample_data_processing = For RNA-seq, featureCounts function (Rsubread version: 3.5.3) was used to count reads (Liao et al. 2014) and DESeq2 (version 3.5.3) was used to calculate differential gene expression (Love et al. 2014).
!Sample_data_processing = For ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq version 2.1.1 (MACS2) (Feng et al. 2012). Differential peaks were calculated using MAnorm (Shao et al. 2012) with threshold of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a p-value of less than 0.05.
!Sample_data_processing = We used HiC-pro (version: 2.11.0) to identify Hi-C contact map (Servant et al. 2015). We then integrated the aligned Hi-C data with the ChIP-seq data to correct the background, perform restriction site bias modeling and obtain looping information using hichipper (version: 0.7.3) (http://aryeelab.org/hichipper).  We identified differential looping events using the diffloop Bioconductor R package (1.6.0) (Lareau and Aryee 2018). Briefly, to calculate EBNA2-dependent differential looping, we first determined EBV-dependent chromatin looping by comparing EBVEBNA2+ looping events to uninfected looping events using diffloop (>1.5 fold, p-value < 0.05).
